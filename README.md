# Air Quality Analysis and AQI Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing air quality data and predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using publicly available data from the **US EPA AirNow** platform. The goal is to explore patterns in pollutants and environmental factors, and build predictive models for AQI values and categories.


## Dataset

- **Source:** [US EPA – AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/)
- **Type:** Tabular
- **Features:**
  - **Continuous:** Ozone, PM2.5, PM10, AQI, latitude, longitude, elevation
  - **Categorical:** State name, reporting area, monitor type, site operational status
  - **Temporal:** Local time, valid time
- **Coverage:** United States, continuously collected from monitoring stations

## Objectives

1. Explore and visualize air quality data.
2. Predict AQI values using machine learning regression models.
3. Classify AQI into categories (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.).
4. Evaluate models and identify important predictors.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZohaibAfzal295/air-quality-analysis.git
